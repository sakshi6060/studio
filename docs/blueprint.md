# **App Name**: Portfolio Pro

## Core Features:

- Project Initialization: Scaffold a new Next.js app with linting, formatting, and key libraries (Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, next-seo, next-sitemap, Heroicons) pre-installed and configured.
- Dark Mode Toggle: Set up Tailwind CSS with class-based dark mode to allow users to toggle between light and dark themes seamlessly, storing their preference in localStorage.
- Static Data Fetching: Load portfolio data from a static JSON file at build time using getStaticProps, making the data available as a prop to the Home component.
- Layout and Theme Hook: Implement a persistent Layout component with navigation links and a theme toggle to provide consistent site navigation and allow theme switching.
- Animated Hero Section: Create a Hero section with animated name, title, and summary, plus CTAs (email and website) to provide an engaging introduction.
- Skills Grid: Display a skills grid where hovering over a skill reveals focus areas and suggested interview questions as a tool for interview preparation. Note: a language model will determine which questions or information about the topic would be more relevant and important.
- Highlights Carousel: Implement a carousel that shows key highlights with metrics and interview questions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) for trustworthiness and professionalism.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F2F8), almost white, to provide a clean backdrop and subtle contrast.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FF9800) to draw attention to interactive elements and calls to action.
- Headings: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font, provides a modern, computerized feel.
- Body text: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif that will be clear and readable on a variety of screen sizes. It is an effective pairing with Space Grotesk.
- Use clean, minimalist icons from Heroicons for a consistent and professional look.
- Incorporate subtle, smooth animations using Framer Motion to enhance user experience without being distracting.
